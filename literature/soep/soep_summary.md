# Principles of Data Structure

- Since individuals are questioned every year, the underlying structure of the
  SOEP is cross-sectional. Each wave has its datasets called $P for individual
  respondents, $KIND for children, etc..
- Static variables like years of education are generated by the SOEP team and
  are stored in files like $PGEN for personal or $HGEN for household
  information
- spell data is named with capital letter like ARTKALEN for employment status
  and EINKALEN for income
- YPBRUTTO contains information about drop-out on the individual level
- BIOPAREN contains biography information about parents, BIOBIRTH contains
  birth information on women, BIOBRTHM on men, BIOJOB on first occupation,
  BIOIMMIG on immigration, etc.

in 2003. Follow-up interviews are planned for critical ages (3, 6, 12)

# The Youth Questionnaire and BIOYOUTH
